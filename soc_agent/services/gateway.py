"""Agent Gateway stand-in: unified routing + policy enforcement in front of the action agent.

Only the action agent identity may call through this gateway, and only with
one of the allowed action types. This is the single choke point that can
touch anything external — everything upstream (ingestion, triage) is
read-only by construction, not just by convention.
