"""Curated attack corpus exercising the ingestion -> Model Armor boundary.

Each case is (label, source_channel, sender, raw_text, expected_verdict).
expected_verdict is used by the demo runner / tests to assert the pipeline
behaves as intended -- not fed to the agents themselves.

CASES (1-5): the original curated set -- one clean textbook example per threat
type, plus one deliberately benign-but-alarming-looking case.

EVASION_CASES (6+): added after probing real Model Armor with obfuscation
techniques (see soc_agent/services/model_armor.py's module docstring for the
_decode_candidates rationale). Evasions tried against the live API, round 1:
base64 encoding, zero-width-space obfuscation, homoglyph substitution,
leetspeak, split-across-sentence phrasing, quoted/forwarded-email wrapping,
and non-English phrasing -- all caught except bare base64 with no plaintext
framing. Round 2: hex encoding and URL-encoding, in both bare form and
wrapped in benign-looking context (a "Ticket update ref#..." prefix, a
realistic https://...?redirect=...&utm_source= tracking-link shape) -- bare
hex/URL-encoded forms were caught, but the *same payloads wrapped in
plausible business content* were not; confidence dropped below threshold
with a benign-looking wrapper around the encoded blob. All three encoding
gaps (base64, hex, URL) share the same root cause -- Model Armor screens
literal text and never decodes anything -- and are closed by the same fix:
_decode_candidates in model_armor.py finds base64/hex/URL-encoded substrings
and re-screens the decoded text. bare_base64_no_hint, bare_hex_wrapped, and
url_encoded_tracking_link below are regression tests for that fix; each
would have scored "clean" before it existed.

One other finding from this round, not an evasion but a live false-positive:
a plain-looking 32-char hex-formatted string ("Transaction ID: a1b2c3d4...")
with zero injection content tripped Model Armor's PI-and-jailbreak filter at
LOW confidence on its own -- nothing in this codebase caused that, it's a
quirk of the real classifier. Worth knowing: an all-block posture on any
LOW-confidence match will produce false positives on ordinary-looking
hex/alphanumeric IDs in ticket content. Not fixed here (would need
confidence-tiered handling, e.g. route LOW-confidence matches to human
triage review instead of auto-quarantine) -- flagging as a known limitation.
